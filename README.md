# inmemorydb
Introduction
the program should handle and manage the tuples of pattern calls with unique
Identification number.
The following use-cases need in this project:
1- the tuples should hold and store in the memory. In this project, the tuples
were not modified and just adding to the storage.
2- Reporting from the in-memory data storage with considering the
complexity order.
3- the program should be production-ready such as maintainable and
documented.
4- The program should contain the test unit. In the instruction, the program
needs a production test to test the basic behavior of the program. Such as
accuracy, reliability, time, etc.â€¦
